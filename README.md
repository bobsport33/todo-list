This todo list app was created using React. The application allows the user to create multiple todo lists, create tasks to complete within each individual list, and assign priority and completion dates for each task. The application will provide feedback to the user if the task is assinged to be completed that day or is overdue. The code can be viewed here on github, and the final product is rendered here: https://todo-list-469ca.web.app/.
